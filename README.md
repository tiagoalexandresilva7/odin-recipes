This project envolves building a main index page linking to a few recipes.

It will look pretty simple but, later down the line, this project will be revisited when I start learning CSS.

I'll try to use skills I've learned so far, regarding HTML:
- Write the boilerplate by myself (without using the !! command);
- Use headings and paragraphs with strong, emphasized text;
- Use images, with local or remote files;
- Use ordered and/or unordered lists;
- Use relative and/or absolute links;
- Commit and push each change with meaningful, concise and short commit messages.
